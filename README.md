# Crossy Score for Android
Android Material Design application for manually recording Crossy Road scores while playing on a TV. I made this application because we are playing on Apple TV with friends and we have no way of recording leaderboards (and Excel sheets are so '00s).

Perfect for parties!

## Structure
The application is using 3 modules: 
- common: contains all of the app models and basic interfaces / response objects,
- core: contains internal data providers and core business logic
- app: contains base UI components, their implementations and dedicated data loaders.
